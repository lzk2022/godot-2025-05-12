	"whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n"

	"liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n"

	"Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n"
	"work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n"
	"other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n"

	"9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n"
	"the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n"
	"and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n"
	"or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n"
	"License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n"

	"Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\n"
	"effect of CC0 on those rights.\n"
	"\n"
	"1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n"

	"of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\n"
	"License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\n"
	"applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\n"
	"invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\n"
	"affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\n"

	"1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n"

	"exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n"

	"a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n"
	"in part; and\n"
	"\n"

	"2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n"
	"Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n"
	"License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n"
	"its terms and conditions.\n"
	"\n"
	"3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n"
	"6(a).\n"
	"\n"
	"4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n"
	"Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n"

	"authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n"
	"necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n"
	"technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n"
	"Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n"
	"simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n"
	"(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n"
	"\n"
	"5. Downstream recipients.\n"
	"\n"
	"a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n"
	"recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n"
	"receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n"
	"Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n"
	"Public License.\n"
	"\n"
	"b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n"
	"any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n"
	"apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n"
	"Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n"
	"Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n"
	"Material.\n"

	"b. Other rights.\n"
	"\n"
	"1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n"
	"licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n"
	"privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n"

	"assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n"
	"extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n"
	"Rights, but not otherwise.\n"

	"collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n"
	"Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n"

	"\n"
	"Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\n"
	"following conditions.\n"
	"\n"

	"\n"
	"1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n"
	"form), You must:\n"
	"\n"

	"with the Licensed Material:\n"
	"\n"
	"i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n"
	"Material and any others designated to receive\n"
	"attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n"
	"the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n"
	"designated);\n"

	"Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n"
	"hyperlink to, this Public License.\n"
	"\n"
	"2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n"
	"reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n"
	"which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n"
	"reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n"
	"hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n"
	"information.\n"
	"\n"
	"3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n"
	"information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n"
	"reasonably practicable.\n"
	"\n"
	"4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n"
	"License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n"
	"Material from complying with this Public License.\n"
	"\n"
	"Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n"
	"\n"
	"Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\n"
	"apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n"
	"\n"
	"a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n"
	"to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n"
	"portion of the contents of the database;\n"
	"\n"
	"b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n"
	"contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n"
	"Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n"
	"Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n"
	"\n"
	"c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n"
	"all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n"
	"\n"
	"For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\n"
	"replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\n"
	"Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n"
	"\n"
	"Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n"
	"\n"
	"a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n"
	"EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n"
	"AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n"

	"PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n"
	"ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n"
	"KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n"
	"ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n"
	"\n"
	"b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n"
	"TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n"
	"NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n"
	"INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n"

	"right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n"

	"c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n"
	"Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n"
	"distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n"
	"will not terminate this Public License.\n"
	"\n"
	"d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n"
	"License.\n"
	"\n"
	"Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n"

	"Introduction\n"
	"============\n"
	"\n"
	"The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\n"
	"some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\n"
	"various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\n"
	"FreeType Project.\n"
	"\n"
	"This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\n"
	"which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\n"
	"affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n"
	"documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n"
	"\n"
	"This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n"
	"(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n"
	"and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n"
	"alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n"
	"\n"
	"o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n"
	"interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n"
	"\n"
	"o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n"
	"full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n"
	"\n"
	"o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n"
	"it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n"
	"somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n"
	"FreeType code. (`credits')\n"
	"\n"
	"We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n"
	"software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n"

	"assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n"

	"0. Definitions\n"
	"--------------\n"
	"\n"
	"Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\n"
	"and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\n"
	"distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\n"
	"Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\n"
	"beta or final release.\n"
	"\n"
	"`You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\n"
	"`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\n"
	"code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\n"
	"This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\n"
	"engine'.\n"
	"\n"
	"This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\n"
	"FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\n"
	"documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\n"
	"original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\n"
	"If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\n"
	"this license, you must contact us to verify this.\n"

	"\n"
	"o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\n"

	"`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\n"
	"\n"
	"As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\n"
	"accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\n"
	"material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\n"
	"authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\n"
	"Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\n"
	"Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\n"
	"of this license.\n"

	"You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n"
	"liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n"

	"5. Termination\n"
	"--------------\n"
	"\n"
	"5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n"

	"compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n"
	"Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n"
	"Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n"
	"ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n"
	"non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n"
	"come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n"
	"Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n"
	"notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n"
	"first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n"
	"from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n"
	"Your receipt of the notice.\n"
	"\n"
	"5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n"
	"infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n"
	"counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n"
	"directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n"
	"You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n"
	"2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n"
	"\n"
	"5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n"
	"end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n"
	"have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n"
	"prior to termination shall survive termination.\n"

	"PREAMBLE\n"
	"The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide\n"
	"development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation\n"
	"efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and\n"
	"open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership\n"
	"with others.\n"
	"\n"
	"The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and\n"
	"redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The\n"
	"fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,\n"
	"redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n"
	"names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n"
	"however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\n"
	"requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\n"
	"to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n"
	"\n"
	"DEFINITIONS\n"
	"\042Font Software\042 refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\n"

	"\042Reserved Font Name\042 refers to any names specified as such after the\n"
	"copyright statement(s).\n"
	"\n"
	"\042Original Version\042 refers to the collection of Font Software components as\n"
	"distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n"
	"\n"
	"\042Modified Version\042 refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\n"
	"or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\n"
	"Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\n"
	"new environment.\n"
	"\n"
	"\042Author\042 refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\n"
	"writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\n"
	"\n"
	"PERMISSION & CONDITIONS\n"
	"Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\n"
	"a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\n"
	"redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\n"
	"Software, subject to the following conditions:\n"
	"\n"
	"1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\n"
	"in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n"
	"\n"
	"2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\n"
	"redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\n"

	"included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n"
	"in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n"
	"binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n"
	"\n"
	"3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n"
	"Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n"
	"Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n"
	"presented to the users.\n"
	"\n"
	"4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n"
	"Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n"
	"Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n"
	"Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n"
	"permission.\n"
	"\n"
	"5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n"
